# Canary COVID Analysis

Welcome to the Canary COVID Analysis project! ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ´

This project, conducted in collaboration with one colleague, delves into an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the waves of COVID-19 in the Canary Islands. The analysis was carried out using RStudio, leveraging various R packages such as ggplot2, gganimate, and others.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary aim of this project is to explore and understand the causes behind the fluctuations in COVID-19 cases in the Canary Islands. We've employed a variety of R libraries and data visualization techniques to unravel patterns and trends.

### Collaborators
- David Cruz SÃ¡nchez
- AdriÃ¡n Perera Moreno

## Project Structure

### Analysis
- **Data Importation**: We started by importing relevant data from the "casos_covid.csv" file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data integrity by handling missing values and transforming date formats.
- **Data Transformation**: Selected and transformed essential variables, particularly focusing on date-related features.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized ggplot2 to create captivating visualizations, providing insights into the evolution of COVID-19 cases over time and across different islands.

### Maps
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapped the normalized COVID-19 cases across the Canary Islands before and after a critical date.
- **Animated Visualizations**: Employed gganimate to showcase the dynamic changes in COVID-19 cases, creating visually appealing animations.

### Visual Storytelling
- **Historical Trends**: Explored historical trends in COVID-19 cases, visualized using ggplot2's geom_smooth function.
- **Year Transition**: Compared and visualized cases in 2021 and 2022 separately.
